"""timing_receive_images.py -- receive and display images, then print FPS stats

A timing program that uses imagezmq to receive and display an image stream
from one or more Raspberry Pi computers and print timing and FPS statistics.

1. Run this program in its own terminal window on the mac:
python timing_receive_images.py

This "receive and display images" program must be running before starting
the RPi image sending program.

2. Run the image sending program on the RPi:
python timing_send_images.py

A cv2.imshow() window will appear on the Mac showing the tramsmitted images
as a video stream. You can repeat Step 2 and start the timing_send_images.py
on multiple RPis and each one will cause a new cv2.imshow() window to open.

To end the programs, press Ctrl-C in the terminal window of the receiving
program first, so that FPS and timing statistics will be accurate. Then, press
Ctrl-C in each terminal window running a Rasperry Pi image sending program.
