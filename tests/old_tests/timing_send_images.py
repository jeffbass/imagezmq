"""timing_send_images.py -- send PiCamera image stream.

A Raspberry Pi test program that uses imagezmq to send image frames from the
PiCamera continuously to a receiving program on a Mac that will display the
images as a video stream.

This program requires that the image receiving program be running first. Brief
test instructions are in that program: timing_receive_images.py.

This program can turn an LED on and off if needed; assumes BCM pin 18. This
can help with lighting the subject area in front of the PiCamera.
