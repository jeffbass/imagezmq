# Contributing to imageZMQ

**imageZMQ** is in active development. I welcome open issues and
pull requests, but because the programs are still evolving, it is best to
open an issue for some discussion before submitting pull requests. We can
exchange ideas about your potential pull request and open a development branch
where you can develop your code and get feedback and testing help from myself
and others.

1. Find a bug? Open an issue.
2. Need help with a problem? Open an issue.
3. Want to suggest a change in the code? Open an issue.
4. Anything else? OK, you're seeing the pattern here: Open an issue

**imageZMQ** is used in my own long running projects and the
projects of others, so backwards compatibility with the existing API is
important.
