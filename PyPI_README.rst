imagezmq: Transporting OpenCV images
====================================

**imagezmq** is a set of Python classes that transport OpenCV images from one
computer to another using PyZMQ messaging. For example, here is a screen on a
Mac computer showing simultaneous video streams from 8 Raspberry Pi cameras:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffbass/imagezmq/master/docs/images/screenshottest.png

Using **imagezmq**, this is possible with 11 lines of Python on each Raspberry
Pi and with 8 lines of Python on the Mac.

First, run this code on the Mac (or other display computer):

.. code-block:: python

    # run this program on the Mac to display image streams from multiple RPis
    import cv2
    import imagezmq
    image_hub = imagezmq.ImageHub()
    while True:  # show streamed images until Ctrl-C
        rpi_name, image = image_hub.recv_image()
        cv2.imshow(rpi_name, image) # 1 window for each RPi
        cv2.waitKey(1)
        image_hub.send_reply(b'OK')


Then, on each Raspberry Pi, run:

.. code-block:: python

    # run this program on each RPi to send a labelled image stream
    import socket
    import time
    from imutils.video import VideoStream
    import imagezmq

    sender = imagezmq.ImageSender(connect_to='tcp://jeff-macbook:5555')

    rpi_name = socket.gethostname() # send RPi hostname with each image
    picam = VideoStream(usePiCamera=True).start()
    time.sleep(2.0)  # allow camera sensor to warm up
    while True:  # send images as stream until Ctrl-C
        image = picam.read()
        sender.send_image(rpi_name, image)


Wow! A video surveillance system with 8 (or more!) Raspberry Pi cameras in
19 lines of Python.

Why use imagezmq?
=================

**imagezmq** is an easy to use image transport mechanism for a distributed image
processing network. For example, a network of a dozen Raspberry Pis with cameras
can send images to a more powerful central computer. The Raspberry Pis perform
image capture and simple image processing like flipping, blurring and motion
detection. Then the images are passed via **imagezmq** to the central computer for
more complex image processing like image tagging, text extraction, feature
recognition, etc.

Features
========

- Sends OpenCV images from one computer to another using ZMQ.
- Can send jpeg compressed OpenCV images, to lighten network loads.
- Uses the powerful ZMQ messaging library through PyZMQ bindings.
- Allows a choice of 2 different ZMQ messaging patterns (REQ/REP or PUB/SUB).
- Enables the image hub to receive and process images from multiple image senders
  simultaneously.

Why ZMQ? Why not some other messaging protocol?
===============================================

There are a number of high quality and well maintained messaging protocols for
passing messages between computers. I looked at MQTT, RabbitMQ, AMQP and ROS as
alternatives. I chose ZMQ and its Python PyZMQ bindings for several reasons:

- ZMQ does not require a message broker. It is a peer to peer protocol that does
  not need to pass an image first to a message broker and then to the imagehub.
  This means fewer running processes and less “double handling” of images.
  OpenCV images are large compared to simple text messages, so the absence of a
  message broker is important.
- ZMQ is very fast for passing OpenCV images. It enables high throughput between
  image senders and image hubs.
- ZMQ and its PyZMQ bindings are easy to install.

**imagezmq** has been transporting images from a dozen Raspberry Pi computers
scattered around my farm to 2 linux image hub servers for over 2
years. The RPi's capture and send dozens to thousands of frames frames a day.
**imagezmq** has worked very reliably and is very fast. You can learn more about
my "science experiment urban permaculture farm" project at
`Yin Yang Ranch project overview <https://github.com/jeffbass/yin-yang-ranch>`_.

Messaging Patterns: REQ/REP versus PUB/SUB
==========================================

ZMQ allows many different messaging patterns. Two are implemented in **imagezmq**:

- REQ/REP: Each RPi sends an image and waits for a REPLY from the central image
  hub. The RPi sends a new image only when the REPLY is received. In the REQ/REP
  messaging pattern, each image sender must await a REPLY before continuing. It is a
  "blocking" pattern for the sender.
- PUB/SUB: Each RPi sends an image, but does not expect a REPLY from the central
  image hub. It can continue sending images without awaiting any acknowledgement
  from the image hub. The image hub provides no REPLY. It is a "non-blocking"
  pattern for the sender.

There are advantages and disadvantages for each pattern.
**REQ/REP is the default.** See the documentation (link below) for more details.

Dependencies and Installation
=============================

**imagezmq** has been tested with:

- Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8
- PyZMQ 16.0 and 17.1
- Numpy 1.13 and 1.16
- OpenCV 3.3 and 4.0
- Raspbian Buster, Raspbian Stretch and Raspbian Jessie
- picamera 1.13 (used to capture images for the tests)
- imutils 0.4.6 and 0.5.2 (used to capture images from PiCamera)

Install OpenCV, including Numpy, into a Python Virtual Environment. Then be sure
to install **imagezmq** into the **same** virtual environment. For example, if
the virtual environment is named **py3cv3**, you would install **imagezmq**
using pip like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    workon py3cv3  # use your virtual environment name
    pip install imagezmq

**imagezmq** has a directory of tests organized into sender and receiver pairs.
You will get all the source code for **imagezmq** including all the test
programs by cloning the GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/jeffbass/imagezmq.git

Source Code and Full Documentation
==================================

**imagezmq** is open source. The source code, tests and
documentation are at `Imagezmq on GitHub <https://github.com/jeffbass/imagezmq>`_.
The documentation, including links to application examples,
starts from the table of contents in the README.
