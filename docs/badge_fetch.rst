The above text will fetch the appropriate badges from shield.io and from
zendodo.org when the text is displayed, for example, in a GitHub Gist.
Then the displayed badges can be viewed, right clicked and saved as
"badgename.svg" in /docs/images. That way, they can display in the README.rst
without having to fetch them live every time the README.rst is loaded.
